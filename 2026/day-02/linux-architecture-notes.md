Linux Fundamentals

- What, Why, How?
- Basics (Baccha level)
- AWS console / Utho Server / Local / Playground
- Linux Commands

DevOps - 
  Operating System
    - Git Bash
    - Cloud Server (AWS, Utho, Azure, GCP)
    - VirtualBox
    - WSL2 (Windows Sub-system For Linux)
    - Dual Boot (YouTube videos)
    - Docker ( next Month)
    - Playground
    - Primary OS Linux

OS

- Windows
- Linux (90% se zyaada apps are 
built & running on linux)
- MacOS

Linux ka Architecture

- A for Applications / User
- S for Shell Commanads (Interactive way to talk to kernel)
- K for Kernel (Computer program - Machine samajhta hai) (C Program -> 1010 (binary))

Linux - Operating System

Heart - Kernel (Core of linux) - Linux Kernel

GUI - Graphical User Interface
CLI - Command Line Interface



- Killerkoda
- Utho
- AWS 
- Local


Linux Flavors / Distributions 

- (We are using )Ubuntu (most commonly used)
- Fedora
- CentOS (Generally used)
- RHEL (RedHat) [Enterprises] [Project]

- What is Linux? Open Source Operating System developed
- by Linux Torwalds in 1991
- Why Linux? 90% of apps are running on Linux

- AWS / Utho or Setup Linux on Local System

"Everything in linux is either a file or a Directory (folder)"

"Everything starts with a process"

File System Hierarchy

/ - Root (You are here)
bin
  - binaries
  - cd (shell command) -> C program -> 10101010
/mnt
sbin

bin & sbin has built in commands to navigate the shell
cd - change directory

Task - 
Write 5 (popular) linux Commands and thier usages

- Create a file or a folder (directory)
Make a folder(directory) [can you do it?]

create a file [can you do it?]

- Copy / move (mv) / remove (rm) / rename (mv) file or a directory
- ip address find (ip addr)
- ping a website (ping <website>)
- Storage / RAM Usage


"Everything is a Process"
Linux padhna bhi ek process hai
1. Linux setup karna aana chahiye (30-45 min)
2. Linux Kaise kaam karta hai (1-1.5 hours)
3. Sirf commands seekhna linux seekhna nahi hai


How Linux OS Works

Power On -> BIOS (Motherboard which loads the Hardware) -> GNU GRUB -> Linux Kernel ko load kar do -> Ubuntu(Or sny linux os) Loading... -> init process / systemd PID 1 -> 
systemctl start nginx/ systemctl start docker/ systemctl start ssh/ systemctl status docker/ systemctl status ssh

cp SRC DEST
cp -> bin -> c prog -> Comp Lang
(Process)
